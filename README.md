# SideStack 
Final Project: SideStack – Side Hustle Earnings Tracker

App Description

SideStack is a beginner-friendly Python program that helps you keep track of your side hustle
money. You can add your earnings and expenses, view all your transactions, and see a summary
showing how much you made, spent, and your overall profit or loss. It’s easy to use and perfect for
personal or small business use.

Included Features

• Add New Transaction – Capture earnings or expenses with description, amount, type, and
auto-generated date/time.
• View All Transactions – Display a list of all stored transactions in an organized format.
• Financial Summary – Calculate and display total earnings, expenses, and net result (profit,
loss, or break-even).
• Error Handling – Prevents invalid entries for amounts and transaction types.
• User-Friendly Menu System – Simple text-based navigation for easy interaction.
• Data Organization via Class – Each transaction is stored as a Transaction object with its own
attributes and methods.

Concepts Applied
• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Created a Transaction class with attributes (description,
amount, type, date) and a method (details) to display transaction info.
• Functions & Code Reusability: Separated logic into dedicated functions (add_transaction(),
view_transactions(), calculate_summary()).
• Lists & Data Storage: Used a Python list to store transaction objects for easy iteration and
summary calculations.
• Conditional Logic: Implemented decision-making with if/elif/else for transaction type validation
and financial summary feedback.
• Loops: Used while loops for menu navigation and input validation.
• Error Handling: Incorporated try/except blocks to manage invalid numeric inputs gracefully.
• Date & Time Handling: Utilized datetime module to timestamp each transaction.
• String Formatting: Applied f-strings for clear and readable output with currency formatting.
